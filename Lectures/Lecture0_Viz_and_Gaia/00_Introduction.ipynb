    "- Gain practical, in-depth experience doing inference on real, open-ended modern astronomical challenges\n",
    "- Build reproducible, well-tested, well-documented software & infrastructure\n",
    "- Learn to work with open data and code, and in an open science environment\n",
    "- Hone presentation (speaking & visualization) skills\n",
    "- Develop skills for future in academia, industry, …\n",
